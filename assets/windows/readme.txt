WAVA is an audio visualizer that aims to aesthetically display music or any sound
playing on the computer.

Using it is simple, just launch the appropriate application shortcut for the
application to open. In case it doesn't open or you want to customize anything
about the visualizer, please refer to https://github.com/nikp123/wava for further
information.

Since you're probably running Windows as your operating system of choice, the
config file can be found at %APPDATA%\wava\config.cfg or just use the
"Configure WAVA" shortcut found in your Start Menu.

In case it is not there, just run the visualizer once again and it will
automatically generate that file for you.

The file is self-documenting so that you won't have to scour the internet in
order to figure out how to use the program. In any case, there's always the
aforementioned project frontpage for more information.

Have fun :D
