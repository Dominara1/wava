        <h1>FAQ</h1>
          <h2>What is XAVA?</h2>
            <p>XAVA is an audio visualizer for your desktop</p>
          <h2>What does XAVA mean?</h2>
            <p>It's an acronym: <strong>X</strong>11 <strong>A</strong>udio <strong>V</strong>isualizer for <strong>A</strong>LSA</p>
            <p>However it also supports: Windows, SDL2, MPD, FIFO, Pulseaudio, PortAudio, WASAPI (Windows) and SHMEM</p>         
          <h2>Who made it?</h2>
            <p>XAVA was originally a fork of 
            <a href="https://github.com/karlstav/cava">karlstav's cava</a> 
            with graphical features, but since has grown into it's own thing. <br>
            It's written and maintained by 
            <a href="https://github.com/nikp123">Nikola Pavlica</a> and various other contributors</p>
          <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
            <p>On the top of this webpage you'll find "Download" buttons, click to download and install it.</p>
          <h2>Where are the non-Windows builds/installers?!?</h2>
            <p>If you aren't on Windows, you'll have to compile it.<br>
            Don't worry, it's litreally just 5 commands.<br>
            One to install the dependencies and the other to compile XAVA.<br>
            Just follow the <a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava#build-requirements">compilation guide</a>
            on the readme of this repository.</p>
          <h2>Can I change how the visualizer behaves?</h2>
            <p>Yes, just follow the
            <a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava#configuration">configuration guide</a>.</p>
          <h2>HELP, it doesn't work/compile or something's broken!</h2>
            <p>Sorry to hear that, but you may have to find out that by yourself.<br>
            You should check if you had missed anything in the 
            <a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava">README</a>.
            Also make sure that your configuration/system is even supported.</p>
            <p>If your troubleshooting skills have lead you nowhere, please check out the 
            <a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues">issues page</a>
            if somebody had encountered the same problem, otherwise 
            <a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/new">file an issue</a> 
            and make sure the problem is described in detail otherwise it will get discarded immediately 
            (I have a life, you know)</p>
          <h2>My system/configuration is not supported.</h2>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/new">Create an issue</a> 
            and describe what is it you want to get supported and in detail. 
            I will reject lazily-written features requests. 
            Also expect that your feature request gets delayed or simply denied for any reason.</p>
