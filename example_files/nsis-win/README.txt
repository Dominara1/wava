Not boring and kinda important README file!
-------------------------------------------

Use the included portaudio-list.exe to configure your output devices, because the visualizer needs an audio source in order to function properly.

Additional configuration options are found here: %APPDATA%\cava\config

For documentation visit: https://github.com/nikp123/cava


Anyway enjoy using my software (or don't) and thanks for using it btw.

Also this project runs on Linux and BSD (unofficially macOS, too), so if you are interested you can install on them too.

And the legal stuff is in 'LICENSE.txt' in the installation directory
